# Beta readiness log

## 2026-10-31 — Batch 1 — CI

**What runs** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on every pull request and on push to `main`; read-only permissions, no secrets, 15 min timeout, one run per ref):
1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (pnpm 10, Node 22)
2. Typecheck: `pnpm exec next typegen && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
3. Unit tests: `lib/*.test.ts` excluding `*.pg.test.ts`

**Not in CI, and why**
- **Production build:** verified by the Vercel preview check; add a CI build step only if a PR ever lacks that check. (`pnpm build` also passes without secrets, but needs network for next/font.)
- **Postgres-backed tests:** `*.pg.test.ts` files are excluded because they need Postgres. Four existing DB-backed files (`author-media-api`, `authored-attempt-api`, `authored-grading-db`, `problem-authoring-api`) self-skip in CI because `AUTHORING_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset. A Postgres job is needed later to run them.
- **Browser suites** (`tests/*.browser.mjs`): not run.

**Known todo:** `lib/corpus-translation.test.ts` test "protected editorial drafts cover every source segment…" fails on inherited corpus punctuation drift. It is marked `todo`; translation data is changed on PR #2.
To remove the todo: after PR #2 merges, delete the `{ todo: ... }` option and the comment above that test, run `pnpm test`, and confirm 0 todo.

Local result: 158 tests, 0 fail, 1 todo, 4 skipped.

## 2026-10-31 — Batch 2 — Error pages and feedback link

**What changed**
- Branded 404 (`app/not-found.tsx`), route error boundary (`app/error.tsx`) and root error boundary (`app/global-error.tsx`). The error pages never render `error.message` or the stack; they show only the digest as a "Reference", with a copy button that falls back to selectable text when the clipboard is unavailable.
- A "Feedback" link in the top nav (icon-only below `md`) and an inline variant on the 404 and error pages. It is a real `<a href>`, so keyboard, middle-click and "copy link" work. The `href` is refreshed from `window.location` on pointer-down, focus and click, so it is current at navigation time.

**Env var:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_URL` (build-time, inlined by Next; set it in Vercel for Production and Preview, then redeploy).
- Current value shape: `https://tally.so/r/rD5oVX?page={page}&ref={ref}`
- Unset or blank: the link is not rendered. Any scheme other than `https:` or `mailto:` is ignored (blocks `javascript:`, `data:`, `http:`).
- `mailto:` also works (adds subject and body, keeps an existing query), so the channel can switch to email with no code change.

**Tally hidden fields:** `page` and `ref`, filled from the URL. Tokens `{page}` and `{ref}` (also `%7Bpage%7D` / `%7Bref%7D`, any case) are replaced with `encodeURIComponent` values. `page` is pathname + search, never the `#hash`, capped at 300 characters. `ref` is the error digest on error pages, empty elsewhere. A URL without tokens is used as-is. Logic and tests: `lib/feedback.ts`, `lib/feedback.test.ts`.

**Analytics:** `<Analytics />` was added to `app/layout.tsx` by PR #23, not here.

**Intentionally not done:** no `loading.tsx` files (no skeletons or streaming boundaries added); no error-reporting service (match digests against Vercel runtime logs); `global-error.tsx` was typechecked but not exercised in a browser, because it only renders when the root layout itself throws.
